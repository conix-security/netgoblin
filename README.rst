About
=====

Hello, this is not the netzob official repository. This is the Netgoblin fork which includes several features which are not in Netzob for protocol reverse engineering.

Netzob is a tool that can be use to **reverse engineer**, **model** and **fuzz** communication protocols. It is made of two components:

* **netzob** a python project that exposes all the features of netzob (except GUI) you can import in your own tool or use in CLI,
* **netzob_web** a graphical interface that leverages web technologies. 

Netgoblin modifiations concern netzob. Netgoblin works great with TAPIRE a Conix not open-sourced(yet) CLI made to RE protocols.

Source codes, documentations and resources are available for each component, please visit their dedicated directories.
